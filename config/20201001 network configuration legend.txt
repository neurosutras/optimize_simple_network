H (6): no weights are structured
I (7): only E_E weights are structured
J (8): both E_FF and E_E weights are structured
J_reward (10): both E_FF and E_E weights are structured, reward location is over-represented by the E cell population
K (9): only E_FF weights are structured
L (11): both E_FF and E_E weights are structured, E cells are RS
M (12): both E_FF and E_E weights are structured, rhythmicity objectives are replaced with fft_residuals compared to FF
N (13): both E_FF and E_E weights are structured, structured weights are skewed to the past
0 (14): E_FF and E_E weights are structured, but E_E weights are scrambled
P (15): E_FF and E_E weights are structured, inheriting delta_peak_weight value from J;
    E_FF and E_E weights are scrambled, selectivity objectives are off
